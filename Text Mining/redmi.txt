Velu for money 💰💸\n', '\nExcellent product\n', '\nHey guys this is TECHBORED! and this is unboxing and also will adding some camera shots.-----------------------IN THE BOX-----------------------1. Manuals with warranty information.2. Charging cable.3. 5V 2A power adapter.4. Transparent TPU case.5. Redmi 6 Pro.----------DESIGN----------1. The transparent case fits well and is a perfect fit. Gives nice feel in hands.2. It comes with a notch that is small and I really liked it, At least Xiaomi has tried to cut out the bezels at this budget segment.3. It sports a FULL HD + display with that 19:9 aspect ratio.4. On the top of the phone there is this infrared sensor secondary noise cancellation microphone and wow there is this 3.5mm headphone jack. Always happy to see this port.5. Now moving to the button than there is this micro USB port situated with microphone and the speaker that is loud but decent sounding speaker.6. Redmi 6 Pro body is made up of both metal and plastic. So this is only where metal is used but on the top bottom and on the sides it is plastic. Also the sim tray is made up of plastic. Buttons are made up of metal thats nice and gives very nice feedback.----------------------------DUAL 4G STANDBY----------------------------There is DUAL SIM with dual 4G standby so you can use both sims on 4G at same time. And here is agood thing that I liked about this and it is that it has dedicated Micro SD card slot.---------------------------FACE UNLOCK---------------------------There is also the finger print sensor that is fast enough to unlock and it also come with this face unlock that is pretty fast and I think it is very much secure. At least it will not be unlocked with your pictures.-----------------------CAMERA SETUP-----------------------1. The best thing that Xiaomi has put in to this Redmi 6 Pro and it is the same camera setup as on Redmi Note 5 Pro. So it has 12Mp with 5mp dual camera setup with aperture of 2.2 and the single LED flash in the middle. Just now I cannot tell in detail that how how camera performs but I have included some shots that are taken on Redmi 6 Pro and I think they are nice, decent and are almost the the same as on Redmi Note 5 Pro.2. This camera setup can record upto 1080p videos at 30fps and it supports EIS and the videos are not much shaky and EIS performs well. Where as on the front is 5MP with aperture of 2.0 camera and its decent.-------------------HARDWARE-------------------1. So it is powered with the same old Snaprdragon 625 and I think think that it is good for the budget smartphones for now and it performs well on this smartphone.2. Redmi 6 Pro is backed up with 4000mAh battery that is great.3. Running on Android 8.1 Oreo and on the top of that there is custom MIUI 9. It will soon get a stable update of MIUI10.4. So the Redmi 6 pro comes in 3GB RAM with 32GB internal mermory and 4GB RAM with 64 GB internal memory variants.\n', "\nHiI have brought this phone on THE GREAT INDIAN SALES Oct 11. Order got delivered on 15th October..This is the honest review after one month of usage.I know lot of people are too lazy to read such a long para review and thus for those People I give a three line review..This phone is definitely a best phone only to got it for a price of 10k. Don't go for the 4GB ram varient which is 13k, instead go for redmi note 6 pro which is about 14k to 15k..And the Detailed Review is as follows as*Design*:Design is simply superb.. Phone is cute and this black color is even Sexy*MIUI*:  I am stock android lover and am new to this miui.. At 1st i struggled, later i loved this UI. XIAOMI promised me MIUI 10 but i haven't received yet..*Battery* : Battery ahh nothing to say am astonished this is the 1st time i am charging once a day.. Thnx to the huge 4000mah battery..Charging time : 2 hrs 10 min from 15% to 100%And it last minimum 1 day and maximum 1.5 days ( even 2days depends upon usage)But the charger wire is short, needs special place and arrangements for charging..*Camera* : This is a place where I get disappointed.. Yes camera is average.. Rear camera has good hardware but the portrait shots are below average.. Front camera uses software to create portraits and it is more better than the rear camera.. The camera is the only place where this phone fails to meet expectations..May be XIAOMI can fix it by a update..*Performance* :Yeah XIAOMI uses SD 625 here little disappointed but ok for this price segment.. Using for a month i didn't face any lag, heating issue etc..*Security* :This phone has face unlock and it works well even in slight dark atmosphere and the finger print sensor is Lightning Fast...*Conclusion* :This phone comes with all sensors and IR BLASTER is rocking.. I control everything with this phone... MIUI gives more custom options..I exchanged old phone and got this phone.. I got lot of offers for this phone.Thus 11k phone i got for ₹5000 appoxAlso I got free screen replacement for one yearBut for othersU can get it for 10k using any bank offer..It's worth every penny even for 10k..But i wont suggest the 4Gb varient which is sold for 13k.. Instead u can go for other optionsThank you ❤\n", '', "\nNow using the Redmi 6 Pro for a month, here's my honest feedback.1. Battery life - This is something worth mentioning. Battery life is excellent in Redmi 6 Pro. It almost gives me around 1.5 days of juice in low use and 1 day approx in high usage. The lowest life I did record was around 18 hours. P.S. my phone is always connected to a 4G network with data on.2. Display: Colours are vibrant and viewing angles are decent. The 18:9 notch screen is vivid and FHD videos are a joy to watch. Tried to play a 4K content which was downscaled yet the quality was excellent. Only small issue is the display has an off-white-ish tint which id a bit let down.3. Dual SIM+ Dedicated MicroSD slot - Unlike the hybrid slot, this device boasts a triple slot, a rare sight in high-end devices. This allows me to use 2 SIMs as well as a MicroSD at one time. Used a 128GB SanDisk card to test and it worked flawlessly.4. RAM management - I tried multiple apps in one time to test the tenacity of the device. With 1.7GB approx free of 3GB in standard use, multiple apps use showed 1.1GB free. Even then the apps were working fine, very less lag and smooth user experience.5. Camera - With dual camera at rear, the photos were good if not best. But low light performance is poor. Too much noise and camera app needs basic enhancement (which I expect in MIUI10 update coming soon). The front camera is no deal breaker yet takes decent snaps in proper light condition and not so good in low light. However portrait mode works excellent and the bokeh is good in both rear & front camera.6. Sound - speaker is mono yet loud. Sound is not jarring and maintain a balance. Loudspeaker on call is decent.7. Face unlock - this new feature only works excellent if in proper light condition. This face unlock doesn't work in low/no light condition.8. VoLTE - HD calls are excellent. No problem at all.9. Connectivity - Wi-Fi & Mobile data both have excellent performance.I recommend this device highly. Expecting better camera performance in later updates.\n", '\nOk\n', '\nOsam\n', "\nOK. Why did I choose this phone?Ans:- My old phone was 2.5 years old. It battery life is getting low. Though i had a power bank i need phone which has bigger display within compact size, better battery backup, nice display, average camera, average processor, bug free user interface.So, How the phone performs?*Design is awesome. Lookwise, the phone is a beauty.* Display is superb. You should have a look @poi which is 434. Even flagship oneplus doesn't have this much pixel density. Not even note5pro,note6pro, & pocophone all have lower ppl than this.Now you can understand the display quality of this phone.* Notch:- This s d first mi phone with notch. Loving it.* Battery:- You get a good battery performance depending upon your usage. It'll give you one full day if you're a heavy user. Moderate usage ll get you 1.5 day. Low usage can deliver2 day battery as Xiaomi claims.* Camera:- Rear camera is good. Front camera is decent. Stay away if you're a camera lover. This s not for u.* Processor:- SD625 eventhogh its old its gold. does the job without lags.multitasking can be done effortlessly. Thats what i do. I don't play much games. From what ive used, i say the performance is good.* Heat generation:-(no one post this as seperate topic...lol) yes. Sometimes its getting hot while charging. But not when you put it to heavy tasking. I think im OK with it.* Fingerprint sensor is OK... But face unlock is bit unreliable...* Touch sensitivity is good though wanting more...Now coming to important topic...MIUI:-Mi is known for quality hardware with flawless software at cheaper pricetag.Nowadays it seems mi has lost that magic touch once Samsung phones believed to have(during early 2010s)...* the specs arent pleasing expect note5(6)pro( i think mi wants to sell note pro series only) other than that none of the mi phones make sense nowadays.Mi says they are making only 5% profit of their hardware sales. But that doesn't justify to permit ads in system apps(eventhough its blockable).No major change in miui.and miui10 upgrade isn't that much enjoyable in this phone. Thereare bugs. So, do not update miui10.\n", '\nPrice wise its good but product wise not that much quality product.\n', '\nGood\n', '\nMi phones have a lot of advertisements now, that are everywhere on all the useless extra software they install (it helps them make a little bit of money )Takes quite some time to follow a thorough internet guide to sit and uninstall all the bloatware apps one by one and then denying them permissions to flash advertisements individually. In fact It makes you wait 10 seconds per app to revoke permissions for collecting your data and then flashing adverts.Since this is a known issue.. whoever buys it should be tech savvy enough to go about turning such stuff off or take the help of a tech savvy friend to do the same.Once the phone is setup by a tech savvy person.. its hardware software combo is shockingly good for the price. It just works.. and efficiently.. Much more than a day of mixed usage.Even if you do not remove all the adverts that keep flashing.. the battery life is good, but then the adverts are ANNOYING. Even the System Cleaner software advertises tons of flashing junk Adverts after its done cleaning!But it for the battery life, And severely good hardiness which is better than the basic 6 because it is thicker to house the larger battery and fairs very well in all the strange drop test videos i saw on the internet before deciding to purchase this model.The MIUI interface is super smooth as usual, this is my 4th MI phone purchased and I also use a their TV and the incredible wifi router (which again has unbelievable software based options only available by brands selling at 5 times higher cost). So yes, this being the 6th Mi product i bought since 2014, I trust the quality.Only issue is you really have to get all tech savvy to get rid of the advertisements. I wish MI stops doing this new trend, there are too many adds. the Finger Print sensor  and face unlock, both work well and even though earlier I had ignored using them before, its a much happier faster experience to use it. However it is not as fast as the flagship models. But not a deal breaker.All in all i would like to say.. The first Redmi 1s i had bought in 2014, still looks brand new and works (but battery life went down and MI does not sell battery for that model after 5 years now) Based on that I expect this one will last 3 to 5 years aswell if treated right.\n', '\nGood 👍👍👍👍👍👍😊😊😊😊😊\n', '\nBadddddddddddd\n', '\nThis company products are amazing\n', '\n1. ScreenFirst of all this notch screen,its a full HD+ display doing justice with this notch hype,and actually this is the best thing about the phone,super bright and crisp colors,I,comepared it real me 2 pro,it has only HD display so you can only run max up to 720 content.So its a really good display deal at this price point with notch and nearly edge to edge screen.2. PerformanceIt has snapdragon 625 with clockspeed of 2.0GHz and adreno 506 GPU,if you dont get it than it means you can nicely run PUBG in low.And dont buy the 3/32 option,its not worth it,4/64 is worth that extra 2k stretch,this how you can use SD 625 to its limits.Its comes andorid Oreo 8.1 and you will get an update of android P.MiUi 10 update is coming soon3. CameraThis is the only down side I found till now.Its really bad and outdated,primary camera is 12+5 mp and there is nothing in the image quality from you can say is a dual camera,there a portrait mode but its just a name with very little work.front camera is even worse,its a 5mp single lens and I think its the same xiomi is giving from redmi 4.Not at all adequate.And no portrait mode on front camera.Though I am not a camera person All I can say about this camera is Functional.That is it.4.BatteryIt is a 4000mah lithium polymer battery which is fairly adequate for 1.75 day of use over wifi and 1 day over mobile data.Takes 1.5 hr to full charge from 0.Battery life is really good.At the end it is a good experience for me because latest android good processor decent RAM ROM,and a good better life to support all this.But Camera is not good I repeat camera is really not good.(Spell check and autocorrect has done everything to ruin this review together, still somehow I managed to finish this review,so please Avoid grammatical and spelling mistakes.And appreciate the efforts by an upvote.)\n', '\n1.  It is a good budget phone in 11k, the main part is excellent battery life, camera is ok not so bad and good too, but the miui features are always great than stock android, built quality is also good#. MAIN POINT IS IT SUPPORT DEDICATED MICRO SD CARD SO GO FOR 11K 32 GB VARIENT IT IS VALUE FOR MONEY, DONT GO FOR 13 K 64 GB VARIENT IT IS NOT VALUE FOR MONEY INSTEAD OF THAT U CAN GOR NOTE 5 PRO FOR 15K2.  Not support fast charging, but charging speed is also good not so bad at 5 volt 2 amp. We can say its semi fast charging technolodgy and it is good.3.  some featues like full screen gestures are too good, this is miui 10 features but you can get in miui9 in redmi 6 pro.4.bottom speaker is ok not too good as well as bad but the earphone speaker is great,5. Does not supprt dual volte but that was not a big issue i use gio sim for volte so that was not a big issue for me,6. Back camera is good, in front u can get a 5 mg pixel camera but friends you get 4000 ml amp battery and miui so it was great. camera is not a big point for me i preffer features first. but i didnt said camera is bad, its ok7. Built quality is excellent, it feals so stylish in hand8. Processor is 2 years old realeased snapdragon 625 wich not bad in my opinion at this price.( I MEAN ONLY IN 11K PRICE NOT FOR 13 K)9.face unlock is also ggod fingerprint scanner is too goodOk at last i want to say it is very good phone in 11k for those who are looking for a battery and feature of miui.

Served me for 3 years\n', '\nOverall performance good.\n', '\nBought this phone as a surprise gift for my wife on her birthday last month and before the start of Great Indian Sale on Amazon. I believe I bought it in the 1st flash sale only on 2nd October. Amazon Pay EMI experience was smooth and delivery was quick as always. Posting this crisp review after a month use of Redmi 6 Pro (3 GB/32 GB).Pros:1) Brilliant full HD display2) Good build quality3) Great Network reception4) Seamless 4G connectivity on both SIMs5) Fast Snapdragon 626 Octacore processor6) Good RAM management (No Lags)7) Good primary camera (13+5 MP) with added features8) IR Blaster (Universal Remote)9) Greater Gaming Experience (PUBG & Asphalt 9 with no lags)10) MI UI 9.5 gives good overall user experience including a greater battery management.Cons:1) 5 MP Selfie Camera at a starting price point of 11 K is totally unjust.2) No wide angle lens on front cam3) Front cam sensor could have been better to counter RealMe 24) The 2 cam setup in primary camera fails to generate great pictures with depth (Bookeh) effect.5) Secondary 5 MP depth effect cam is not integrated well to generate greater depth effect (Expecting a camera software update soon for improved experience).6) Primary camera sometimes struggles to focus on non-human object while taking still pictures7) Single speaker could have been a bit better8) 5.84 inch FHD screen is good but a 6 inch screen could have been much betterOverall its a good phone considering the fact that its the very first phone from MI with a notch screen however it certainly lacks that one great punch in front camera department. At least a quick software update is must to enhance the overall quality of the images produced by its 5 MP selfie cam.\n', '\nPhone is good but battery is not so much good as expected\n', "\nHi Guys ,Impressed with Amazon !!!!!I ordered the product on 2nd October and got it delivered on 3rd October Morning !!Very Fast Delivery !!Let's Talk about the phone-Display- Quality of display is good for the price you are paying but there is type of yellowness in colour reproduction which is in warm toneRating- 4 out of 5Performance - The Performance of the phone is good which is all because of Snapdragon 625 but it's litle outdated atleast Xiaomi should go for Snapdragon 630 but still good at its priceRear Camera-Rear Camera is excellent and is the best camera you will gonna find in 10K Price Range.

(google camera mod doesn't work with front camera, so no comments)Rear camera- stock cam app- it takes good avg photos in daylight ,not stunning or eye catching through.Google cam mod- this makes entire world of difference through, the detailing lighting is great with gcam, Night vision also works great , portrait shots with gcam sometimes cant detect edges properly and only works with human object/faces ..(if u comfortable with unlocking rooting, go do it and install gcam mod, may void warranty through)Display - 4.5/5clearity is superb here. switching from note 5 pro, 6pro's display produces great colors, brightness levels are also upgraded.Notch-space around the notch is kind of useless ,it always shows network,battery and clock all the time, And doesn't show any notification icons,u have to drag notification drawer.BATTERY -4/5backup is great ,on normal usage easily last 1 and half day.Sound- 4/5loudspeaker /main speaker- sound is clear,somewhat deep, and has avg level of loudness, no problems here.Earpiece/incall speaker-its small speaker but i would say quality is great, loudness is also above average , speaker is upgraded here.Earphone Jack- sound amplifier for jack is great ,i've used sennheiser CX-213, ..( install V4A with well know profiles, root and unlocking required here)I wont recommend this device as it doesn't worth 11k, instead go for note 5 pro.\n", '\nBahut hi Achcha phone hai tikau phone hai aur is Phone ko Lene se value for money per mahsus Hota Hai\n', '\nGood... ordered for maa & she likes it\n', '\nReview after 1 week.Battery🔋: Take 10hrs to consume 50%.Take 1hrs to charge 45% and after unplucking the chager it increase about 6% in 1.5hrs.Camera📷: Need to update in flash in night modedynamic range filter.

The first phone worked without any problem on the same networks (Jio, Idea) while the second phone lost connetions at high density areas with same networks.

Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone.

The earpiece is also not that loud.3) Performance : RAM Management has not been done well in this phone . Out of 3Gb , I just had 800Mb free out of the box.MIUI has ads. Who puts ads in the UI!?? This is absolutely ridiculous. The UI is not smooth ,it\'s laggy and glitches alot. 4)Rear so called "Dual camera" : The secondary camera is just a gimmick. It\'s just a depth sensor that comes into play when you take portrait shots. Many phones just do the background blurring in portrait shots using AI.Dual camera is just for name sake here.5) Build quality : This phone is not ALL-METAL!I\'ve seen some reviews mentioning that it\'s an all metal body. It is not , It\'s a polycarbonate body.6)Heating issues : Heats up alot when mobile data and location is turned on.FORGET ABOUT PLAYING GAMES ON THIS PHONE.WHEN IT CANT HANDLE BASIC TASKS , PLAYING GAMES IS JUST A DREAM.BASICALLY WHAT IN TRYING TO SAY IS : DONT BUY THIS PHONE. MY HONEST OPINION. I BOUGHT THE PHONE , IM SUFFERING.THERE ARE MANY BETTER OPTIONS OUT THERE. DONT EVEN CONSIDER BUYING THIS PHONE.\n', "\nawsome product. I am more than happy. great buy for me during festive season 10+10% discount from SBI & Amazon plus 1000 extra discount with exchange. SO overall great buy for me.about mobile its quite awsome with good built quality and good look. good battery life around 40 hours for with coc gaming and using interent contiuously in day hours. so gaming experience is good but there is little lagging while playing PUBG against all reviews on youtube because this little lagging destroys the whole gaming experice. also we can't except more for this price range, sound quality is great with earphone, good without earphone but not great, they have made it more noisy in effort to make it louder.however all good buy for me. thanks to amaon and thier amazing offers and pro customer behavious and service. However I don't know why they have closed reviewing on Redmi Y2 As I have bought that mobile also. which is also good mobile but lack HD screen.\n", '\nThough the phone is using hardware of its predecessor but packed in new display and body is giving it somewhat a closer look of iphone x . One can call it the cheapest replacement of an iphone x with almost similar user interface and unlock and emoji functions. The phone is lag free , good camera pic quality. I am not into gaming but multitasking is also lag free. Good response time. Though i got it as a non prime user so couldnt get the discount as amazon didnt give me one month trial subscription as the payment through debit card was reserved for only kotak and icici bank users, a big turn off and money making policy on behalf of amazon as debit card payment was open for 999 plan from any bank debit card. Overall the product is absolutely fine and also one thing the phone takes around 2.45 hrs to fully charge, bit of a disappointment. Otherwise this budget will meet your demand in many ways.\n', '\nVery good product\n', '\nUsed perfectlly but suddenly motherboard stopped working. Had to buy a new one.\n', "\nWorth buy with this price.  Speed and performance wise its good for an average user.Some of the drawbacks are,1. Full screen option for apps makes it weird. If you open the whatsapp status, it is overlap with black shaded area on the top of the screen.2. Camera quality is very low and looks like normal VGA camera pictures.3. It doesn't have dual volte support at the same time. You have to choose sim for volte manually one at a time.Overall, its good for normal users who wants to often check the social media apps, some banking apps, food delivery apps, watching videos on youtube, hotstar and making few calls etc...\n", '\nGood product\n', "\nThe good-Nice displayGood battery back upGood soundGood rear cameraSmooth n fast performanceFace recognition in dark alsoButton mirroring and full screen gesturesThe bad-Form factor - looks out of proportion considering length and width, bit thick; 19:9 ratio good for nothing as most apps doesn't support the feature, turning off notch to get 18:9 display doesn't work correctly, it hides part of display from top- that's the worst part of this phone.Front camera- beautify doesn't exist, unlike other mi phones, no AI for selfies, terrible photo quality.No USB type c !!!? No fast charging or chargerNo screen guard, only back cover - both are required and good quality screen guard not available in market for this phone. So should include both in package.Most apps don't support the poorly designed notch display, video streaming is terrible on YouTube - notch becomes useless.The ugly-Not up to MI set standard. It always felt getting more than the price paid for all mi products - I have used 7-8 mi equipments.This time it felt mi charged more than what it gave back.Feels like thoughtless design, they just made something with a notch because they had to have such a feature in their portfolio of products.MI 4 feels more balanced than this..Not good MI.\n", "\nBought this phone for my Dad and I am hoping it is built well and can withstand falls and scratches:-)Most of the apps needed upgradation and when upgraded the OS it started giving issues like volume buttons not working, device hung issues. After factory reset the issue somehow resolved. Asked for a tech visit from Amazon to check the device on 15th Oct(received the product on 11th OCT)..Good response from Amazon..Also Redmi puts screen cover (which makes it difficult to view the screen and needs to be removed) in the front and no temperred glass hence you need to go to the market to buy tempered glass which is not good. Also no headphones in the box.Front camera is not good but that's okay for a 10k phone. Also the design is not exciting compared to VIVO and OPPO full view phones.Overall good budget phone under 10k and if your priority is Full view screen and good RAM and processor.\n", '\nBest cheapest quality of phone with value of money of middle class people.i realy suggest this phone who are in need of phone within budget.

It was under warranty but still you don't want to visit the service centre so soon.Otherwise, performance wise it's going good. I play games like pubg without much hassle.Mixed reaction !\n", '\n1. It has sleek looks, a black beauty!2. The shiny back cover is really superb, making the phone non-slippery.3. The 4000 mAh battery lasts quite long, while the charging speed is not high, like in other phones but does not matter to me.4. The 12 MP camera quality is really great and proves that the mega pixels rating is not the only parameter for excellent pictures!5. 4 GB RAM and 64 GB internal memory is more than my need and hence I have not bought a micro SD card!6. The screen - 2280 x 1080 pixel resolution and 432 ppi pixel density 5.84 inch screen is much better than most phones (except the high end ones, which are expensive).7. The phone is not too big to fit into any of my pockets.8. I have not experienced any heating issues, may be because my use is simple and limited. No games!9. It has fingerprint and face unlocking and many other latest features.The only missing essential is Gorilla glass protection, which will have to be bought. This is a minor issue to me.This phone is a wonderful deal at 10 K! Go for it!\n', '\nVer good  phone . Friends Amazon is a very big company.  But soon after we buy products and we login next time, they are not giving any details about the product or what we have purchased. That means they are deleting the records and we will not have a proof of purchase. The bill they are giving with the product is with delible ink. The words will disappear in one or two months. How are we sure that the products are genuine and warrsnty is valid ?  Its a matter of concern.  Be careful.\n', '\nI bought the phone during the Summer Sale, so I got it for Rs 9,999/-. Though I was really disappointed just after purchasing it the price further dropped to Rs.8,499/-! But it\'s a worthy buy under 10K. Now coming to the phone, the colour I ordered was blue and it is beautiful. The feel of the phone is perfect. Those who don\'t want a "big" phony yet want to flaunt it, it\'s perfect for them. The 5.84 inches FHD+ display is fluid and vibrant. The 625 Snapdragon chipset is a reliable processor for fast multitasking. The cameras are just ok , 5MP in the front and 12MP+5MP rear setup. Although it has AI face recognition, I would suggest you to avoid it as sometimes it may lag under low light conditions. The fingerprint sensor is smooth, unlocks in a giphee. Now the best part of the phone is it\'s battery life, the 4000mAh high capacity battery is surely to deliver a long lasting service. It runs on MIUI OS which is easy to use and people are getting familiar to this nowadays. To sum up, the phone is a competitive contender under the 10K segment of smartphones.\n', '\nPROS:DISPLAY - Resoulution very good very crisp well saturated natural colur .PERFORMANCE - Performance of this phone very good , no lag , no heating issue fast experince , ram managment very good .CAMERA - 6 pro rear camera picture quality amazing , potrait mode such as a dslr*, low light imaging avg , video stabaliztion very good, slowmotion video good.Front camera very poor , daylight avg image but low light picture quality of this phone is very poor , noise is too much .BATTERY - Battery is very good , charging time 2.10 hours , backup time 16 hours continue net surfing.DESIGN - A good nitch display phone , little weighty , Back metal design very premium .CONS :Front camera very disapointing.Rear camera need little bit improvement .Mi UI 10 still unavilble in this device .\n', "\nI have been using this phone for past 9 days and overall the phone is good.You already know the spec and pros so I'll go to the cons directly.**Cons**>>The notch isn't perfect as there are software glitches for different apps in the notch area but it's nothing a new update cannot fix.>>The camera isn't fast enough in HDR mode but again this isn't something a new update cannot fix.>>The phone could've come with a screen guard preinstalled as is the case nowadays in all phones.>>Xiaomi should refrain from putting all the unwanted apps in the phone but luckily some can be unistalled and some can't be.>>The price is a bit on the high side or atleast they could have given a much more current processor.So overall go for this phone if you're not a gamer and is Looking for a decent phone with current specs(almost).*Winks ;)\n", "\nNice mobile phone with good battery life. 4G VoLTE + 4G VoLTE was offered, (2 Jio Sims) but it was not supporting initially.

Other two best phones in this category are Honor 9n and newly launched Realme 2 pro.. Realme 2 pro is a good phone, but don't know whether it will be on sale for atleast 2 seconds in the flash sale because of its high demand.. I prefer redmi 6 pro over honor 9n because of the reputation of Xiaomi brand.. From redmi 1s onwards I am using Xiaomi mobiles and they did not disappoint yet.. Now let's go through pros and cons of this mobile..Pros.------1. Superb display.. It's crisp, clear and bright.. you can not take your eyes off the display.. I am using LG G6 with 2k display as my first phone for last 1 year and believe me Redmi 6 pro's display is more brighter than LG G6..2. Powerful battery.. It is easily lasting for 2 days even after moderate use and full time on 4G..3. Nice design and build quality.. Even though  the bezzels are little bit thick compared with honor 9n still it looks more premium in looks.Cons-------1. Front camera is worst compared to other models..2. Bezels are little bit thicker than other notch phones3. Rear camera is just ok.. it works well in day light.. but in low light/indoors it disappoints you..\n", '\nAbsolutely useless. Typical Chinese product. Battery not available at their service centre.  Eventually sold it for ₹ 500 as scrap.\n', '\nBest battery life\n', '\nPROS:1. Display is very sharp and crisp, even beats my earlier OP3 phone.2. Battery is a beast, I do crazy gaming and surfing but it still holds up till the end of the day with atleast 25% battery remaining.3. Very good processor, GPU and RAM, can play high end games in low/medium setting without any hiccups.4. Expandable external storage is a life saver for those interested in shooting long FHD videos.5. IR blaster with MI remote is a cool feature, my family are shocked as to how am controlling TV, SetTop Box and AC with this phone.6. Rear camera is good, takes sharp pics in good lighting conditions.7. Ringtone and speakers are fairly loud.Cons:1. Selfie camera which is 5MP which is still ok, but this is a budget phone for 11K, so obviously they would cut down costs with the camera.2. No fast charging support. It takes around 2.5 hours to charge the 4000mAh battery.FINAL VERDICT:If you are looking at a primary phone with well rounded package for 11k which has awesome display, battery and decent rear camera or a great secondary all rounder phone then this is the best in the market. If u are a selfie lover, strict no for this phone, better choices are MI Y1 or 2 for 1k more or other good selfie phones. Kudos!\n', "\nOver all it's an awesome product with this price. However, there is a little problem with the front camera. Back camera is really good. But front camera does not give proper clarity of the pictures. The phone is really good to click a picture at day time. But at night it won't give you satisfactory result even if there is high voltage light. The phone also has a lot of unwanted inbuilt apps that will consume your data balance very soon. If the quality of the front camera is little bit improved, it will be the best one to purchase.\n", '\nGood product\n', '\nGood\n', '\nI am writing this review after one year usage. For the current price and choice of phones available in market i would say it is not a value for money phone. If the price of 3 GB Ram and 32 GB storage variant is near about 6k to 7k then I would recommended. I bought for 11k. With respect to that times market this deal was overpriced but still could be considered due to notch display, metal body, face unlock, dual camera, image stabilizer, and obviously finger print sensor.Processor was good at one time but it is little outdated and in this phone I feel there is a issue with optimisation. Performance is quite balanced but playing games like pubg will be like phones with snap dragon 425.

So plug charger in night remove in the morning (as after full charger it'll automatically disconnect charger current running to the phone).Processor- The old yet trusted Snapdragon 625 octa-core CPU, good for normal race games (NOT much suitable for PUBG). Bit of lag sometimes here and there.RealMe2Pro has got a bang for buck deal here with looks and processor.

It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam.

There were Redmi note 7, 7 pro, 7A etc available for slightly more price. But I stick with this simply because its size at 5.84 inch is so compact and fits into small or average palms. Another of my requirement was 4GB ram and at least 64 GBROM both of which this phone matches.Processing is good and doesn't get heated while playing games like virua tennis pro etc. Battery lasts one full day for heavy usage and 1.5 days for average usage. Phone is kind of not very delicate and fallen down from my hands a number of times but caused no scratches or damage- still running on original plastic cover.

The process is cool. Its not lagging; everything is perfectly working fine.The Camera is the only thing I'm not satisfied with. I preferred the front camera to be at least a little bit more clear when shot at low lights. The Back camera is good. Overall my experience in this phone is great except for the camera.One more thing, the phone has two speakers at the bottom. One of them weren't working from the moment I opened the package. Well. didn't make much difference in sound as the single speaker made sufficient sound for me. So I din choose to make a complaint. So that's it.

Coming to the cons by noticing this price of Rs 11k :-1) No dual volte support, even the lower model redmi 6 has that feature (which is priced at only 8000rs),but not available on the model which is priced at 11,000 rs. Mi is just fooling customers with this model.2) below average front camera quality, only 5mp.3) again the same boring design of phone.4) notch design makes the phone look ugly, it could be better (but mi hasn't worked seriously on this).5)outdated processor, especially at this price point when others are providing sd 636 at same price(e.g - Asus zenfone max m1 pro)6) display quality is also not that much great whn compared to asus, honor or other devices at 12k price range.7) screen size also looks quite small due to notch on the top.. Its should be 6 inch.Pros of this device -1) good battery, 4000 mah.2) solid metal built quality.3) dual rear cameras is somewhat of good. Quality( but not great at all) .P. S - honestly saying, this is not a worthy phone, better to go. With redmi note 5 pro. At a. Slightly higher price otherwise go for Asus or honor or real me.They are providing much better value for money.Mi seriously needs to work at its strategy after seeing the stiff competition in thd market currently.This phone should be priced at only 8k.\n", '\nHonest Review after 3 years of full use...I have been using this phone since 2018This all shots were taken with Redmi 6 pro...Accompanied with The Macro lens Skyvik Signi X..Camera Beast..Battery life is nice..which can outstand one day of charge..and Nice processor with comparatively smooth gaming and software running...Sound quality was just awesome but after 3 yrs of use it degrades a bit...If you are seeing Budget phone for all round performance..Ths one is for you...~ Sayor Dutta\n', "\nOrdered Red colour 32Gb variant but got confirmation of black colour...Received black unit withing 2 days of order..With no cost EMI offer it was a great deal. 👍About phone:Red mi 6 Pro is great in battery life2 days backupCamera is great as well.. nice portrait shot from front single 5mp cameraOutdoor shots are great as always...Low light shot ar just ok.Smooth interphase and good phone in this price range...Notch display give the premium feel.1 sim VOLTE support at a time.Can't user 4G in both sim at at time.Built quality is great. Premium feel.\n", '\nVery good\n', '\n👍\n', '\nOsm phone\n', "\nEvery things OK in this price range notch i like it battery life good for normal user. One main thing i had noticed that company say its dual sim it support 4g+4g sim but when i insert my jio and airtel sim so no network in Jio sim so company say dual 4g but not in sim 1 its 4g in second its 3g . and i try to make video call from airtel 4g like Jio i can't make . i don't know whats the problem . but when i insert only Jio sim in sim one then i can make video call .\n", "\nThis is my first Mi device. Had been a Samsung fan for many years.I compare with my Samsung galaxy J5.ProsMuch better battery.Screen clarity is better.Loved the notch.Value for money compared to Samsung.Feature rich.ConsHeavy device.Interface is clumsy and not user friendly.Lots of unwanted apps which cannot be uninstalled eating up space.Can't find a way to move apps to SD card.Amazon delivery was superfast. Exchange was also smooth.Bought in great Indian sale.Haven't obtained the 10 percent Amazon pay balance as advertised in the sale.Will update after more use.\n", '\n1. Super mobile used last 5 to 6 years ther is no mistake faced .2. Small mobile compare with mi max 2 and note 5 pro3. Slim &  sleak4. Super5 l\n', '\nI liked it very much and posting this review after so long just to say that guys this is seriously very nice phone... Battery life, finger sensor, sound quality, connectivity, etc., features all are nicely working and camera is also good as compare to others. Lastly, there is no hang issues with it.\n', '\nVery good product the delivery was on time charge stands for more than a day if you let it drain to 30%The sound is not best byt good for this priced phoneThe camera quality is top both front and backThe performance is good not lagging when switching between apps with more than ten open at the same time. It is doing good for a 4gig ramStorage is not a problem as it has 64gb and i am a regular user of drive and google photosThis phone also enters the notch club giving a larger screen place\n', "\nPros:- Notch display with handy size- Battery back up is good, lasts for one day- Back camera is okay for this price- Options like split screen, dual apps, smart screen are very useful- Finger print unlock speed is good- Processor speed is good even for gaming- Good audio, video call quality- Sound quality using headset is very good- Battery tips coming from MI are usefulCons:- Some time installed apps getting hang like swiggy, wynk music, chrome browser- Notch is not much useful. So many things missed like hotspot,headset,notification- Front camera, not good in low light- Battery heats up while charge even data off mode and no usage- Battery used to work for 2 days initially now it went to 1 day!! Even with normal usage.Over all: If you're a MI product lover and not worried about Camera but battery and price, you can go ahead. Otherwise there are lot of good phones avail in this price range with very good features.\n", "\nDisplay quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.\n", '\nAs MKBHD says piller of good phone are1 Display:- here the display is very good colour seems pretty acurate display is top notch and the notch is pretty bad2 camera:- must admit camera is pretty bad rear camera is only good selfie camera is horroundorous3 performance:- snapdragons 625 is very tried and trusted chipset and it does not heat as well pretty good for day to day activities and can game light games also4 software:- i like mi software its quite polished and packs in alot of features overall a good ui\n']
